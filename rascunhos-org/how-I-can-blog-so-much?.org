* How can I blog so much?

- It was not like this in the past
- Now, a mixture:
  - Emacs
  - Org-mode
  - Git/GitHub
  - Org-publish
  - Touch Typing
  - macOS karabiner elements -> emacs keybindings
- It took me a long time to achieve this
- in 2012, I remember first year in college, I would prefer writing on
  paper, and then typing
- my high school was not based on digital stuff
- no one used computer, everybody was using physical old-school
  notebooks
- 2020-milestone do blog, mas foi com Javascript vanilla, HTML, CSS,
  codepipeline, Amazon S3, melhorei no uso de Git e GitHub
- 2021, aprendi emacs, org-mode, melhorei no Git
- 2022, macOS e touch typing

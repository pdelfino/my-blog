* The Day I Had Lunch with Warren Buffett

This isn’t an AI-generated photo. A decade ago, I had the rare
opportunity to meet the Oracle of Omaha in person for a Q&A session
and lunch.

Every year, Warren Buffett would host groups of Ivy League students
and a small number of Brazilian students from top universities. I was
fortunate to be selected as part of the latter group.

I still have my notes from that day and have long intended to write a
detailed blog post about the experience. It's been ten years, yes, ten
years of procrastination, and friends keep urging me to finally share
it.

Feeling nostalgic, I decided to post a brief reflection here on
LinkedIn. I rarely post, but this one feels worth it.

One comment from Warren struck me deeply and has stayed with me ever
since:

“The most important decision in your life is who you marry.” He
emphasized the importance of character when making that choice.

His words seemed wise then, but with time, they've only grown truer.


Since we’re on LinkedIn, let’s keep things in perspective: most of
your connections here, if not all, won't be at your funeral, or your
parents’.

Your career matters, yes. Work can even be sacred, as St. Josemaría
Escrivá once said. But family matters more. Period.

Everyone is gracious in fair weather; true character shows when the
storm hits.

Observe how people behave in moments of tension: small arguments,
moderate conflicts, and full-blown crises. That’s when the real test.

As Esther Perel (not a Christian, by the way) puts it:

“Love is a verb. It’s not just a feeling. It’s something we do,
especially when it’s hard.”

Choose wisely. And if reproduction is involved, as it often is, the
stakes are even higher. The consequences can be profound, even tragic,
for those parts of the universe that still have their whole future
ahead of them

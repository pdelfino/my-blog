* Cool quotes

**  Alex Banayan

All highly successful people treat life, business, and success just
like a nightclub. There are always three ways in.  There’s the First
Door, where 99% of people wait in line, hoping to get in.  There’s the
Second Door, where billionaires and royalty slip through.

But then there is always, always…the Third Door. It’s the entrance
where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, climb over the
dumpster, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, and
sneak through the kitchen. But there’s always a way in.

Whether it’s how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software, or how
Steven Spielberg became the youngest director at a major studio in
Hollywood — they all took the Third Door.

**  Haseeb Qureshi

If there’s one thing this job search had taught me, is that there’s
always, always more money on the table.

** Sam Altman

Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked
down.

All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to
evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press,
investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong
communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of
execution ability.

Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an
investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is
to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise
language.

Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward.

Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but
make 100x if it works

Keeping your life cheap and flexible

It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to
work many hours.

Extreme people get extreme results

The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven;
they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel
compelled to make something happen in the world

** Nietzsche

He who has a why can bear any how.

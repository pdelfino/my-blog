* Cool quotes

**  Alex Banayan

All highly successful people treat life, business, and success just
like a nightclub. There are always three ways in.  There’s the First
Door, where 99% of people wait in line, hoping to get in.  There’s the
Second Door, where billionaires and royalty slip through.

But then there is always, always…the Third Door. It’s the entrance
where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, climb over the
dumpster, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, and
sneak through the kitchen. But there’s always a way in.

Whether it’s how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software, or how
Steven Spielberg became the youngest director at a major studio in
Hollywood — they all took the Third Door.
